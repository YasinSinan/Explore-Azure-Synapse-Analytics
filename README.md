# Explore-Azure-Synapse-Analytics
Azure Synapse Analytics provides a single, consolidated data analytics platform for end-to end data analytics. In this exercise, I explored various ways to ingest and explore data. This exercise is designed as a high-level overview of the various core capabilities of Azure Synapse Analytics.

ðŸ‘‰ An Azure Synapse Analytics workspace provides a central point for managing data and data processing runtimes. 
ðŸ‘‰ Synapse Studio is a web-based portal in which I can manage and work with the resources in my Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
ðŸ‘‰ I could perform with Azure Synapse Analytics is to define pipelines that transfer (and if necessary, transform) data from a wide range of sources into my workspace for analysis.
ðŸ‘‰ In Synapse Analytics could use a serverless SQL pool to run SQL code against data in a data lake.
ðŸ‘‰ In Azure Synapse Analytics, I could run Python (and other) code in a Spark pool; which uses a distributed data processing engine based on Apache Spark.
ðŸ‘‰ In Azure Synapse Analytics, these data warehouses can be implemented in a dedicated SQL pool.
